## Socket Server Auto Scaling Flowchart

- Used AWS ELB & Auto Scaling to deal with high-loading issues.
- Solved socket server synchronization issues of horizontal expansion with sticky sessions and Socket.IO-redis.
- Reshaped the traffic by clearing cookies when users join rooms.

## Features

### Synchronous Browsing

- The game will keep showing the drawing all the time, whether the player joins the room after the game has already started or leaves the room then rejoins again.

#### Technique
- Used <span>Socket.IO</span> with redis to simultaneously browse drawings in each room.

### Game Start System

- Players can choose either single or multiplayer when starting the game. System will also decide a game mode automatically if players press the quick start button.

#### Technique

- Prevent a player from joining a room multiple times in order to gain abnormal scores. 
- When quick start mode activated, <span>Socket.IO</span> will check the concurrent users then guide players into 3 possible situations as follows:
  1. if there are no concurrent users, players will be directed to single player mode.
  2. if there are concurrent users with open rooms, players will be directed to a room as a guesser.
  3. if there are concurrent users with no open rooms, players will be directed to a room as a drawer.

### Chat Room

- Accomplished a real-time group chat room.

#### Technique

- Utilized <span>Socket.IO</span> to achieve user communication in real-time
- Built an answer filtering system to prevent cheating by regular expressions.

- Players can choose their favorite headers or upload their own photos.

#### Technique

- Stored and delivered images by AWS S3 and CloudFront service.

### Rank System

- Players can earn points in the game to instantly improve their rankings.

#### Technique
